# weather-api
**Project description**
(![Alt text](weatherapi.png?raw=true "Weatherapi"))

Weather-api is a one-page web app that tells users the current weather based on location entered.

I built this to integrate the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) and display weather information in a neat, minimalist and accessible single page. 

Users can enter either a city or a post code in the search bar.

Weather is displayed in both Celcius and Fahrenheit for accessibility. A clear icon appears to symbolize if it is sunny, cloudy, rainy or snowing.

More information about humidity and windspeed is available in the bottom right corner. 

In completing this project, I practised using a JSON restful API. I would like to use Weather API's astronomy data in the next update of this project.

**How to install and run the project.**
